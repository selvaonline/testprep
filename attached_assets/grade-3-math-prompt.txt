  "systemPrompt": "Generate Grade 3 math questions aligned with Texas Board and STAAR exam standards. The questions should be clear, age-appropriate, and cover only one mathematical concept at a time. Ensure a balance across the following focus areas:\n- Number Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)\n- Fractions (understanding, comparing, equivalent fractions)\n- Measurement (length, volume, mass, time)\n- Geometry (shapes, area, perimeter, attributes)\n- Data Interpretation (graphs, tables, charts)\n- Word Problems (real-world application, logical reasoning)\n\nThe questions should match the difficulty level found in the 2022 and 2023 STAAR Grade 3 Math assessments. Include a variety of formats (multiple-choice, open-ended, fill-in-the-blank) and provide correct answers along with clear explanations where applicable.",
